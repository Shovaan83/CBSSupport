# CBS Support System

## Overview
CBS Support is a modern support system built using .NET technologies. The solution consists of multiple projects:

- **CBSSupport.API**: A web API built with ASP.NET Core that handles backend operations and real-time communication using SignalR
- **CBSSupport.MAUIApp**: A cross-platform mobile/desktop application built with .NET MAUI
- **CBSSupport.Shared**: A shared library containing common models and utilities

## Technologies Used

- .NET 9.0
- ASP.NET Core
- .NET MAUI
- SignalR for real-time communication
- PostgreSQL with Dapper ORM
- Bootstrap for UI styling

## Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or later (recommended)
- PostgreSQL database server
- For MAUI development:
  - Windows 10 version 1809 or higher for Windows development
  - macOS Catalina (10.15) or higher for iOS/macOS development
  - Android SDK for Android development

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   - Install PostgreSQL if not already installed
   - Create a new database
   - Update the connection string in your configuration

3. **API Project Setup**
